# DataAnalysisProject

##Hey ! 
### This is my first Data analysis project , in this project there are 4 main phases:
1. Data scrapping process using scrapy python libary.
2. Data cleaning with external python file
3. Data analysis and visualisation using numpy, matplotlib and seaborn libraries.
4. Data prediction with machine learning models using scikit-learn library.

###Hope you will enjoy the project, I certainly enjoyed writing it :)
